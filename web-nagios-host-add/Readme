How it behaves
Add Host
Enter domain → “Check”
If found → “Host already exists.”
If not found → “Not found” + Confirm Add button.
Confirm Add → appends your exact block (only host_name/alias/address changed), then optional restart.

Remove Host
Enter domain → “Check”
If not found → “Host not found.”
If found → shows how many blocks will be deleted (1 host + N services) + Confirm Remove.
Confirm Remove → deletes the host block and all service blocks for that host_name, then optional restart.
